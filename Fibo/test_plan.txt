//6 files which a brute code will pass i.e. n,r<1000 and m<1000
//6 files where n and r as low as above but m is >1000 and less than 5*1e7
//4 files containg n higher than 1000   i.e.
//1 file containing 2 cases of n higher than 40000 and less than 50000
//1 file 1 case:: n=100000
//1 file 1 case:: n=100000
//1 file of worst case period's and n is even and r is n/2 and n>100 and <1000
