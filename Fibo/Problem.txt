T test cases:

Calculate Fib(nCr)%m::


Fib(i) = Fib(i-1) + Fib(i-2)   -->  Fib(0)=0 and Fib(1)=1 

nCr => number of ways of choosing r objects out of n objects.

Constraints::

1<=r<=n<=100000
m<=1e7
Summation n over all T is less than or equal to 100000
n and r are coprime to m // For trolling :D
