Every File wil have T=50 and every T will have N=100
Out of these 50 T cases , 45 are of the form where Value of the product J < C and 5 cases have J>=C

Each File will be based on interval partitioning
1) 100 different intervals
2) 90 ...................(rest 10 should be choosen as a subinterval in the 90 intervals)
3) Similarly for 80
4) Similarly for 70
5) Similarly for 60
6) Similarly for 50
7) Similarly for 30
8) Similarly for 10
9) Similarly for 1
10) All Intervals have same S[i] and E[i]
