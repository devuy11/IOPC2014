Given a Tree where each node stores a value(intially they are all 0). 
Each Tree has some value(denoted by r).
You are then given a continous sequence of U updates and then a continous sequence of Q Queries.
Update (X, A, B) : add series (1*X*(r^1),  2*X*(r^2),  3* X*(r^3),   4*X*(r^4),   5*X*(r^5)..) from node A to B in shortest path.
Query (A,B)  : Find the Sum of Nodes from node A to B in the shortest path Modulo 100711433.

Input Format

First line contains two integers (N and R respectively) separated by space.
In the next N-1 lines, the i-th line describes the i-th edge: a line with two integers a b denotes an edge between a, b.
Next 2 space separted Integers (U and Q respectively) representing the Update and Query operations to follow.
Next U lines follow each line asking to update the node values as explained above in the Update operation.It contains 4 space separated integers (X,i,j respectively).
Next Q lines, each line containing 2 integers (i and j respectively) , Output the answer to each query as explained above in Query Operation.

Output Format

It contains exactly Q lines and each line containing the answer of the ith Query.

Sample Input::
6 2
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
2 2
2 3 4 5
4 5 2 3
2 3
3 6

Sample Output::
728
480

Explanation::
After first Update ::	0 48 0 12 144 0
After Second Update::   160 88 480 12 144 0
For First Query ::   88 + 160 + 480 = 728
For Second Query ::   0 + 480 = 480

Constraints
N<=100000
R<=10e9 and R>=2
X <=1e9
U<=100000
Q<=100000
